WP vCard Manager WordPress Plugin
=================================

*WP vCard Manager WordPress Plugin* creates a new custom post type "vcards" where you can manage all common properties of a vcard. VCF File and QRCode with vCard data will be generated on save. hCard and h-card output is also supported. Alternative QRCode images with white or black color transparent are generated too.

You can use some shortcodes to use in content, also functions for use in theme. You can also copy the generated data and use ist wherever you want.

Generated output is according to 
[vCard RFC#2426](http://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc2426), 
[hcard spec](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard), 
[h-card spec](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card)
